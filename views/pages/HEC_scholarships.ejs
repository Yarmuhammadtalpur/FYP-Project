<p class="margin_all">Pakistan has no shortage of talented youth, but in several instances, 
    lack of resources prevents them from realizing their potentials. This becomes more problematic when 
    it comes to accessing higher education. The Government of Pakistan acknowledges these constraints and 
    has tasked Higher Education Commission to facilitate the needy and deserving students through Need Based 
    Scholarships. Scholarships have been announced for financially disadvantaged students of as many as 94 public sector universities and their campuses. 
    <br>The scholarships aim to elevate the socio-economic status of the students by enabling their chances to 
    get the modern education and career opportunities for their brighter future.
